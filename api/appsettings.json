The water-cooled six-cylinder bi-turbo Boxer engine with four-valve technology, variable turbine geometry (VTG) and VarioCam Plus delivers its power through the rear axle. From a displacement of 3,600 cm3, it generates an enormous 456 kW (620 hp) at an engine speed of 6,500 rpm. The maximum torque of 700 Nm is available from 2,250 rpm. From 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) takes just 3.5 seconds."
